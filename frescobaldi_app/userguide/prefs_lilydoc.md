=== LilyPond Documentation ===
    
Here you can add local paths or URLs pointing to LilyPond documentation. A 
local path should point to the directory where either the `Documentation` 
directory lives, or the whole `share/doc/lilypond/html/offline-root` path.

If those can't be found, documentation is looked for in all subdirectories 
of the given path, one level deep. This makes it possible to put multiple 
versions of LilyPond documentation in different subdirectories and have 
Frescobaldi automatically find them.
