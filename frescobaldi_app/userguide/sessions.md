=== Sessions ===
    
A session is basically a list of open files. At any time you can choose 
{menu_session_save} or {menu_session_new} and save the current list of open 
files to a named session.

When you switch sessions, all current documents are closed first and then 
the documents of the other session are opened.

Inside the session properties dialog, you can choose whether to always save 
the list of open documents to that session, or to only save on creation (or 
via {menu_session_save}). This can be useful if you want to keep the list of 
documents in session the same, even if you open or close documents while 
working.

You can also specify a default directory for the session.
