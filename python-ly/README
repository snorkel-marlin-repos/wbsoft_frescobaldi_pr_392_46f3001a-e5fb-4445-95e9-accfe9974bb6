Python, no build procedure is needed. You can install python-ly using:

    python setup.py install


If you want to install into /usr instead of /usr/local:

    python setup.py install --prefix=/usr


If you have a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu, and you get an error

    python setup.py install --install-layout=deb
