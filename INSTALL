INSTALL for Frescobaldi 2.0.
============================

You can run Frescobaldi without installing. Just unpack and then run:

  python frescobaldi


The Frescobaldi package is based on distutils. No build process is needed as
Frescobaldi is fully written in the interpreted Python language. To install in
the default location:

  sudo python setup.py install


To run Frescobaldi, then simply type

  frescobaldi


If you want to install into /usr instead of /usr/local:

  python setup.py install --prefix=/usr


If you have a Debian-based system such as Ubuntu, and you get the error
message "ImportError: No module named frescobaldi_app.main", try:

  python setup.py install --install-layout=deb


See the distutils documentation for more install options.


Dependencies:
=============

Frescobaldi 2.0 is written in Python version 2.6 or 2.7 (3.x support is planned)
and depends on Qt4.7 and PyQt4.8, and uses the python-poppler-qt4 binding to
Poppler for the built-in PDF preview.

For MIDI the PortMidi library is used, either via importing 'pypm',
'pyportmidi._pyportmidi, or, if that is not available, loading the pygame.pypm
module from pygame; or, as a last resort, embedding the PortMidi C-library via
ctypes. MIDI is optional.

Required:
    Python (2.6 or 2.7):
        http://www.python.org/
    Qt4 (>= 4.7):
        http://qt.nokia.com/
    PyQt4 (>= 4.8.3):
        http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/
    Poppler:
        http://poppler.freedesktop.org/
    python-poppler-qt4:
        https://github.com/wbsoft/python-poppler-qt4

Optional:
    PortMidi:
        http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/portmidi/

Of course you'll need to install one or more versions of LilyPond!


"Freeze" installer:
===================

The freeze.py script can create a self-contained Windows-installer, bundling all
of Python, PyQt4, popplerqt4 and pypm (from pygame) when used on MS Windows.
To use the script you need cx_Freeze and Inno Setup.


Mac OS X application bundle:
============================

The macosx/mac-app.py script can build an application bundle on Mac OS X.
To see the usage notes, run:

  python macosx/mac-app.py -h

The application bundle will be created inside a 'dist' folder in the current
working directory. The application bundle is NOT self-contained.
To use the script you need argparse (included in Python >= 2.7) and py2app.


For Linux distribution packagers:
=================================

Frescobaldi contains some files by default which are also available in other
packages often used in Linux distributions. It is possible to remove those
files after installing/packaging and make Frescobaldi depend on the package
containing those files. This makes the filesystem less cluttered, and copyright
files simpler.

Icons:
You can remove the frescobaldi_app/icons/Tango directory, and make Frescobaldi
depend on the tango-icon-theme package instead.

Hyphentation dictionaries:
You can remove the hyph_*.dic files from frescobaldi_app/hyphdicts, and make
Frescobaldi depend on a package that installs hyphenation dictionaries in
/usr/share/hyphen/ (or another dictionary listed by default in frescobaldi_app/
hyphendialog.py).


The ly module:
==============

Frescobaldi provides a Python module (ly) that can be installed separately,
without requiring the rest of Frescobaldi. This can be done using the setup.py
script in the python-ly directory. This folder also contains the command line
tool "ly" that makes the functionality of the ly module accessible via the
command line.
